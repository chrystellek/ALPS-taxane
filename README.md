# ALPS-taxane

By Chrystelle Kiang

This is a project using the Algorithm for Learning Pathway Structures in the taxane metabolic pathway to explore how genetic variants in the pathway affect the outcome of breast cancer recurrence. Code is taken from James Baurley, Tom Ahern, and Maret Mellow.

This project is using Danish Registry data, so I have no actual data on hand, but I can post the dummy data I used to get this all coded up. 

Steps for pulling code together and my own notes are in steps.qmd file.
